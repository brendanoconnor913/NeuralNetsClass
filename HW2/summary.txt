We see that partitioning the dataset in half and performing regression
results in the same rank of subsets (same relative performance). 
However, when we look at the AUC's we see the absolute performance
decrease when not using all of the data for training (as expected).
Particularly we see that when the subsets are limited to a few 
features the lack of data has a greater impact on performance.
