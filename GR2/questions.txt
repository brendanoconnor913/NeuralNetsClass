Want single digit size output depth 

Error using removedelay (line 57)
Removing 1 to input delays would result in a negative input weight delay.

Error in MiniProject3SubjectSpecific (line 48)
        net     = removedelay(net);

    Wouldn't we want to remove the delay for each iteration of training?
        For subject specific we aren't reinitializing the network
